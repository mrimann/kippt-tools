What's this all about?
----------------------
I started playing around with kippt.com which looks promising as a successor for the beloved del.icio.us which (since acquired by that big company) lost a lot of the power that I liked. And since I already had a del.icio.us to MySQL-Backup script in place, I thought something like that needs to be possible with kippt.com, too.

And here we go: A rough first draft of a kippt.com backup script - maybe a migration tool from del.icio.us to kippt.com will follow.


Backing up all your kippt.com bookmarks to MySQL:
-------------------------------------------------

How to do?
..........
1. Clone this repository

2. Create a database with a table called "clips" (see database schema file in the cloned directory)

3. Copy config.sample.php to config.php and enter your local database credentials together with your kippt.com username and API-Token
   You can find your kippt.com API-Token by visiting the following "page" with your browser while being logged in: https://kippt.com/api/account

4. Run the script : php -f kipptBackup.php
